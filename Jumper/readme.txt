As the second programming assignment I choose a simple version on doodle/bird-jump.

After starting the programm, you can control the bird with the "cursor-left" "cursor-right" keys to move it left or right. There are three different types of "stairs": 

- a normal one where the bird can jumps normal height

- a extended stair, where the bird jumps up a double height

- a breaking strair, where the bird can't jumps on

different colors and different sound for each type of stair makes is nicer to play the game.

----

for the programming there are two classes:

- the bird (ball) that encapsulates all methodes for controlling the bird (draw, reflect, bounce, ...)

- the stair (step) that encapsulates all methodes for a single stair. all stairs are stored in an array of strairs.

the control-logic of the game is done in the main draw-methode.

----

have fun.
